      <h1>Thoughts on the Reading:</h1>
      <p>The term "docile sleepwalkers" reminds me of how people appeared when the panic buying started. Although I
        experienced it in person/stores, I also saw a lot of media striking fear into its viwers which I think played
        a big part in the panic buying. Once pictures of empty shelves go viral, it urges people to ask themselves why
        they arnt doing the same. What people see in the media heaviy influences what the new norm will be. We also
        see how this panedmic has called for social reform. Unfair distribution of money and accessibility to necessities
        has been exposed.</p>
